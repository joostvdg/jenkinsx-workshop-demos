# The X-Files Demo

[The X-Files](https://the-jenkins-x-files.github.io/) is a workshop created for Jenkins X by [Vincent Behar](https://github.com/vbehar).

There's three parts:

* [Mulder](/xfiles/mulder): backend
* [Scully](/xfiles/scully): frontend
* [Integration](/xfiles/integration): ???

If you want to *cheat*, the workshop with all direction can be found [here](https://github.com/the-jenkins-x-files/workshop).

For a good practice, follow the instructions on this site, as they force you to solve the puzzles yourself.
